A working Cosmos OS GUI

This was a bit tricky. If you follow the Cosmos guide on creating GUI basics, https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/wiki/Creating-a-GUI---The-basics you'll get here but the way you create the projects in VS has to be very specific. You need to create the hardware project first, then create the main project and add it to the hardware solution, this way when you build the project it will build the main one correctly. This is hard/impossible to fix if you do it out of order.

Nontheless, this one works so you can use it as a base.
